# <h1 align="center">Chatter-io</h1>
## Overview
Chatter-io is a demo real-time chatting application. Users enter their username, and they are connected to the 'Guest' chatroom. Connected users can see the list of other connected users in the chatroom as well.
This project includes a small server portion in [this repository](https://github.com/ajj-siraj/chatter-io-server), employing Websockets to facilitate the communication between connected users.

Initially, I had planned to give users the freedom to create their own chatrooms, and to allow them to search existing chatrooms as well, but I realized that would create unnecessary back-end complexity when the focus of this project for me was the React front-end side.

## Live Demo
Finally, you can find a live demo of this application at: https://chatterer-io.herokuapp.com. You can open it in multiple tabs to test if there are no connected users.
